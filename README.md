# Hosts - Python hosts file manager
This is a Python script that adds and removes entries to your `hosts` file. It was created to assist in adding and removing these entries when doing CTF's which often require adding entries to your hosts file.

I was tired of manually adding entries and never cleaning them up, so I created `hosts.py` to help manage that for me.
